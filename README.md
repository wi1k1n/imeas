## Imeas

A tiny web/javascript app for making linear and angular measurements on images.

### Shortcuts:
* RMB	- drag image
* wheel	- zoom to cursor
* alt + wheel	- zoom to center
* r	- ruller tool
* LMB	- new node / drag node
* shift	- constrain new node
* ctrl+LMB → node	- add new node
* MMB / d → node	- delete node
* shift+MMB → node	- delete whole chain
* shift+d → node
* esc	- cancel current ruller chain
* o	- place image to center
* space	- reset position and scale
* i	- toggle interpolation
* b	- toggle border
* ? / h	- show this help
* ctrl + v	- paste image from clipboard (only in Chrome)


### TODO list:

- Show angles (A hotkey)
- Drag&Drop on MMB as well as RMB
- Magnifier
- Show perpendicular sign, when constrained 2 b perpendicular to previous edge
- Cursor grid to stick to image pixels
- Handle onWindowResize event
- Make it possible to continue chain (from both sides)
- Color picker
- Close chain on hotkey (draw it as dotted line)
    - Show angles and perimeter/square in details information (like inspect in fusion 360)
